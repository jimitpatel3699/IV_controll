An IOT based system can measure the available fluid level in fluid bag, and measure temperature, heart rate, spo2 of patients. System can develop using microcontroller like node-mcu, and different type sensors like loadcell,HX711, max30102,I2C Module, LCD display etc.
System can record real values using sensors and through microcontroller it can be perform several operation on real time sensors data and send it into database.
for backend process system using PHP, MySQL database.
for frontend system using HTML, Bootstrap, Java script.
for tools using vscode, XAMPP.
